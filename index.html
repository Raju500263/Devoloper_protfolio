            <h2>Hi. Iâ€™m , a freelance Front-end Developer with 2 years commercial experience creating successful

            <p>CSS3 Foundations is a book I wrote in 2012 guiding readers through the process of using CSS3 features and
                techniques to take a basic website template and turn it into a real-world, modern and future proof
                website.
                It was published in paperback and digital formats by Wiley and later translated to Chinese. It was well
                received with a review score of 4.5 out of 5 on Amazon.</p>
